        <p class="subtitle">Asserting Democratic Control over the Browser/Search Funding System
        </p>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>Browsers, and the browser engines that power them, provide critical public infrastructure to over five billion people and yet no one pays for their browser. To cover the high cost of maintaining such highly complex systems, browser vendors and search engine providers have developed a system in which money is levied from search revenue and distributed to browsers. This arrangement benefits both: browsers don’t have an obvious revenue model and web search engines are only relevant to the extent that the web is, which in turn requires a high quality, frictionless browsing experience.
        </p>
        <p>Over the years, this ad hoc system has succeeded in providing funding to browsers but it suffers from a string of issues that produce detrimental effects on the web and the digital sphere in general: lack of transparency, poor funding of browser engines, defunding of other parts of the web, massive market concentration, plummeting search quality, harms to privacy, improved funding for misinformation, reduced revenue for quality journalism, and loss of opinion pluralism.
        </p>
        <p>This report documents the existing system, analyses its negative externalities so as to determine requirements for alternatives, and proposes paths forward. The existing levy distributes billions of USD annually; the objective is not to eliminate it but to place it under the kind of governance that can make it operate in the public interest and in a manner that is resilient to ongoing AI-driven transformations of both browsers and search engines.

        </h1>
        <p>Many former or current employees from browser vendors and search engines large and small provided crucial information on condition of anonymity. I am deeply thankful for the time you gave me and you dedication to fixing this arrangement, even though your employers benefit from it.
        </p>
        <p>Many thanks to all the participants in the lively and highly-attended browser funding workshop at Web Engines Hackfest 2025 — this document surfaces many of your views — and to Igalia for their warm welcome and outstanding organisation. Special mentions to Brian Kardell, Eric Meyer, Stephanie Stimac, and Xan López for your contributions to browser funding issues and precious conversations.
        </p>
        <p>The following people (in alphabetical order) have provided invaluable input into this draft: Dietrich Ayala, Matthew Frehlich, and Max Gendler.
        </p>
        <p>Finally, special thanks for the Digital Infrastructure Insights Fund (DIIF), particularly to Katharina Meyer, for funding this report. I had a great time meeting and exchanging with others in my cohort.
